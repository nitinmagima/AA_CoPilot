    Historical data is essential to validate forecasts and define triggers. This process involves:
    - Identifying "bad years" or periods of significant humanitarian impact (e.g., droughts).
    - Ranking historical events by severity to inform thresholds for action.
    - Evaluating forecast accuracy using metrics such as hit rate and false positives.

    **Steps for Historical Data Validation:**
    1. Collect historical data on hazards, impacts, and vulnerabilities.
    2. Identify years with significant impacts using participatory processes.
    3. Define thresholds for severity levels (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).

    **Process:**
    1. **Data Selection:** Identify the relevant parameters (e.g., precipitation, vegetation indices).
    2. **Define Triggers:** Establish thresholds for readiness and activation phases.
    3. **Action Mapping:** Assign specific anticipatory actions to each severity level.

    **Example:**
    - **Mild Drought:** Distribute drought-resistant seeds and conduct awareness campaigns.
    - **Severe Drought:** Provide cash transfers and scale up health interventions.

    Predictive models for anticipatory actions should have the following features:
    - **Data Quality:** Use high-quality and complete datasets for accuracy.
    - **Forecast Skill:** Balance forecast accuracy with lead times to enable timely action.
    - **Operational Feasibility:** Ensure the model can be applied in real-time scenarios.
