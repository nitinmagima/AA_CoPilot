    Anticipatory Action Plans (AAPs) are standard protocols that guide the implementation of anticipatory actions (AAs).
    They link hazard thresholds and triggers to specific actions, timelines, and costs. A well-designed AAP ensures:
    - Timely activation of AAs.
    - Effective resource allocation.
    - Clear roles and responsibilities for stakeholders.

    An effective AAP includes:
    - **Hazard Thresholds and Triggers:** Defined levels of risk that activate actions.
    - **Anticipatory Actions:** Predefined interventions tailored to the expected hazard.
    - **Timelines:** Detailed schedules for readiness and activation phases.
    - **Budgets:** Estimated costs for each action and the overall plan.
    - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clear assignment of tasks to stakeholders.

    **1. Define Hazard Thresholds and Triggers:**
    - Use historical data and predictive models to identify thresholds.
    - Align triggers with forecast lead times for timely activation.

    **2. Design Anticipatory Actions:**
    - Tailor actions to the specific hazard (e.g., cash transfers, health supplies).
    - Ensure actions are time-bound and cost-effective.

    **3. Establish Timelines:**
    - Map out readiness and activation phases.
    - Identify key windows of opportunity for intervention.

    **4. Allocate Resources and Define Budgets:**
    - Estimate the cost of each action and the overall plan.
    - Ensure pre-arranged financing mechanisms are in place.

    **5. Assign Roles and Responsibilities:**
    - Engage stakeholders in the planning process.
    - Clearly define tasks for government agencies, NGOs, and other partners.
